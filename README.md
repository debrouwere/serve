Use *serve* to quickly serve up a directory of static files. Serve supports live reloading, so anytime you change a file, it will automatically refresh in your browser. You can also trigger a command (or a [Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) target) on each file change, e.g. the recompilation of any assets that have changed.
